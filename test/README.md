# Testing `super-glue`
The goal of this document is to help contributors develop tests for `super-glue`.
This is done by
giving an overview of the relevant build systems,
a description of how the test driver expects tests to be set up,
and a brief overview of the `cmocka` testing framework used by `super-glue`.

This is not a comprehensive guide to `cmocka`;
for a full description, see the [api docs](https://api.cmocka.org/).
